this works cos of the the same number of columns but can't be used if there are different datas like Age and Salary mixed  together is wrong.
SELECT EmployeeID, firstname, age 
FROM [SQL Tutorial].dbo.EmployeeDemographics
UNION 
SELECT EmployeeID, JobTitle, Salary
FROM [SQL Tutorial].dbo.EmployeeSalary
ORDER BY EmployeeID
